# Holo Taco Nail Polish Generator

## Description

This project is a nail polish generator using nail polishes made and sold by Holo Taco. It will use random to first select a base polish and the finishing polish, and it will use random to select the main polish and topper polish based on the users input. If the user inputs something that is not one of the listed options, it will tell the user to try again until the user corectly inputs an option. 

## Technologies
- Python

## Getting Started

1. Clone 'https://github.com/REMELH01/HoloTacoPolishGenerator'
2. Respond to the inputs within the program when it begins.

## Features

1. Includes lists of data in the form of nail polish names, seperated by the type of nail polish it is.
2. Uses functions to randomize a nail polish based on the type of polish it is.
3. Uses custom funcitons to pick a nail polish from the randomized funtion in '2', based off of the users 'input'.
4. If the user enters an incorrect option or spells an option incorerctly, it tells the user to start again and begins the previous sequence over.
5. Prints statements with custom anssers based off the users 'input'. 
6. Includes a README explaining the generator and its functions.

## Limitations

Holo Taco is a vastly expanding brand of nail polish created by Cristine Rotenburg, also known as simplynailogical on YouTube. This program only includes a small percentage off the nail polishes made and produced by Holo Taco, up to 

## Obstacles

There are some nail polishes included in this program that, unless previously owned, are no longer available for purchase, as they were limited addition nail polishes sold by Holo Taco. 

## To Do
Going forward after Code Louisville:
1. Add an interactive GUI (potentially using tkinter).
2. Add more of the nail polishes created by Holo Taco.
3. Better define the nail polisah types, rather than using the basic type.
