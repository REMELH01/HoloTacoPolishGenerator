# Holo Taco Nail Polish Generator 

## Description 
This project is a nail polish generator using nail polishes made and sold by Holo Taco. It will use random to first select a base polish and the finishing polish, and it will use random to select the main polish and topper polish based on the user's input. If the user inputs something that is not one of the listed options, it will tell the user to try again until the user correctly inputs an option. The goal is to give the user an effortless way to choose their next nail polish look without having to choose themselves. 

## Technologies 
- Python 
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started 
1. Clone 'https://github.com/REMELH01/HoloTacoPolishGenerator' 
2. Make sure you have matplotlib installed.
3. Respond to the inputs within the program when it begins. 

## Features 
1. Includes lists of data in the form of nail polish names, separated by the type of nail polish it is. 
2. Uses functions to randomize a nail polish based on the type of polish it is. 
3. Uses custom functions to pick a nail polish from the randomized function in '2', based off the user's input. If the user enters an incorrect option or spells an option incorrectly, it tells the user to start again and begins the previous sequence over. 
4. Prints statements with custom responses based off the user’s input.  
5. Includes a README explaining the generator and its functions. 

## Limitations 
Holo Taco is a vastly expanding brand of nail polish created by Cristine Rotenberg, also known as simplynailogical on YouTube. This program only includes a small percentage of the nail polishes made and produced by Holo Taco. The only polishes included in this program are the ones personally owned by the creator of the program. 

## Obstacles 
There are some nail polishes included in this program that, unless previously owned, are no longer available for purchase, as they were limited addition nail polishes sold by Holo Taco. Additionally, since Holo Taco is a rapidly growing brand, they are consistently putting out new nail polishes. As such, the program is not up to date on the most recent collections released by Holo Taco. 

## To Do:
Going forward after Code Louisville: 
1. Add an interactive GUI (potentially using tkinter). 
2. Add more of the nail polishes created by Holo Taco. 
3. Better define the nail polish types, rather than using the basic type. 
4. When the polish choices are given (whether randomized or based off the user’s input), have the sentence also state which collection the polish was a part of. 

## License  
Holo Taco is a trademarked company owned by Cristine Rotenberg. 

### For Code Louisville: 
This project was created in part for fulfillment of Data Analysis Pathway 1. There were only 3 features required from a list of 5 categories, and this project includes 4/5 of those categories (‘Read data in’ using lists, ‘Manipulate and clean your data’ using functions, ‘Analyze your data’ using custom functions using input, and ‘Interpret your data’ with this RADME.md). Thank you for your time.
